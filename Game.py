    Primary game engine for the sim. players should be a list of players
    as defined in Player.py or bots.py. verbose determines whether the game
    will print the result of individual rounds to the console or not.
    
    Per the rules, the game has a small but constant probability of ending
    each round after min_rounds. The current defaults are completely arbitrary;
    feel free to play with them.

    End_early is an option to allow you to better test your strategy.  If specified
    as True, the game will end if the 'Player' player is eliminated (in addition
    to ending if any of the other game end conditions are met).
        
    Call game.play_game() to run the entire game at once, or game.play_round()
    to run one round at a time.
    
    See app.py for a bare-minimum test game.
